/**
 * Fact-read visibility trust.
 *
 * Fact rows are tagged `private` | `world`. Remote/untrusted callers
 * (`remote === true`) see only `world` rows — the posture that keeps a
 * published or HTTP-served brain from leaking private claims to strangers.
 *
 * But the stdio MCP server is an unauthenticated LOCAL pipe: on a single-owner
 * machine the caller IS the owner, yet it still defaults `remote: true` for
 * safety, so the owner's own agent is denied the owner's own private facts
 * (e.g. `find_trajectory` returns empty over MCP even though the facts exist).
 *
 * `trustedFactReads` is a narrow, READ-ONLY trust elevation, deliberately
 * DECOUPLED from `remote` so every other remote protection — file_upload
 * confinement, source isolation, fence stripping, takes-holder scoping — stays
 * fully in force. The stdio MCP server sets it ONLY when the brain owner opts
 * in via the `facts.trust_local_reads` config (default off). The HTTP/published
 * transport never sets it, so a served brain stays world-only regardless.
